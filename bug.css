The CSS rule `:nth-child(n)` selector can cause unexpected issues if not used correctly.  For example, using `:nth-child(odd)` or `:nth-child(even)` on elements within a complex layout might not target the intended elements if other selectors are also applied or if the element structure is changed dynamically.  This is because `:nth-child` is based on the *order* of elements, not necessarily their visual positioning or other properties.
