# CSS :nth-child selector unexpected behavior

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the CSS `:nth-child` selector in complex layouts, especially when the DOM is modified dynamically. The `:nth-child` selector targets elements based on their position within a parent, which may not always align with visual expectations.

## Bug Description

The primary issue is the unpredictable behavior when `:nth-child(odd)` or `:nth-child(even)` is used in conjunction with other CSS selectors or when the DOM is manipulated via JavaScript. This can lead to styling inconsistencies and unexpected visual glitches.

## Solution

Use more specific selectors like class names or IDs. If you must use `:nth-child`, thoroughly test its behavior in different scenarios, particularly those involving dynamically changing content. Consider using more robust and less ambiguous approaches to styling, especially for complex layouts.
